<!--
Sooo... I'm relearning how to program and code. This was my first project, my first night of work. I will try to keep up to date with each program on here as well so that I will have a permanent record of my progress as I learn. If you are reading this, please dont laugh too hard at the juvenille attempts at what you have already mastered. I'm learning, fuck off.
